Fundamental forces Representation of the electric field vector of a wave of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation. The electromagnetic force is one of the four known fundamental forces the strong nuclear force , which binds quarks to form nucleons , and binds nucleons to form nuclei the weak nuclear force , which binds to all known particles in the Standard Model , and causes certain forms of radioactive decay particle physics though, the electroweak interaction is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction); the gravitational force All other forces (e.g., friction , contact forces) are derived from these four fundamental forces and they are known as non-fundamental forces [10] The electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the exception of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in interactions between atoms can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged atomic nuclei and electrons of the atoms. Electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement. This includes the forces we experience in "pushing" or "pulling" ordinary material objects, which result from the intermolecular forces that act between the individual molecules in our bodies and those in the objects. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of chemical phenomena A necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons' movement, such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the Pauli exclusion principle [11]
