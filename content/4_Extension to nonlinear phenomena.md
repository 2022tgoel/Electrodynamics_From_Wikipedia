Extension to nonlinear phenomena Magnetic reconnection in the solar plasma gives rise to solar flares , a complex magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon. The Maxwell equations are linear, in that a change in the sources (the charges and currents) results in a proportional change of the fields. Nonlinear dynamics can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical laws. This is studied, for example, in the subject of magnetohydrodynamics , which combines Maxwell theory with the Navier–Stokes equations
